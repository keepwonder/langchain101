In April 2023, LangChain had incorporated and the new startup raised over $20 million in funding at a valuation of at least $200 million from venture firm Sequoia Capital, a week after announcing a $10 million seed investment from Benchmark.[3][4]\\n The project quickly garnered popularity, with improvements from hundreds of contributors on GitHub, trending discussions on Twitter, lively activity on the project\\'s Discord server, many YouTube tutorials, and meetups in San Francisco and London. As of April 2023, it can read from more than 50 document types and data sources.[9]\\nReferences[edit]\\nExternal links[edit]'}]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mCould not parse LLM output: LangChain is a project that was launched in October 2022 as an open-source project by Harrison Chase.
